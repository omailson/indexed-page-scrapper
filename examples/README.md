# Examples

Here are some commented examples on how to use this tool

## Generate example data

To generate the sample data you first need to run the `data_generator.py` (just once)

```sh
$ ./data_generator.py
```

Type the command above inside the `examples` directory. This will generate some data folders that will be used in our examples.

## Run the examples

Each example needs to be executed as a python module from the project's root folder.

eg: If you want to run the first example, just type:

```sh
$ python2 -m examples.example1.example1
```

Feel free to edit those examples in order to better understand how this library works
